					<!-- URL for site code is https://davin2020.github.io/legacy-hickey-law/ however Javascript image fade is not currently working while hosted on github -->
					<!--<em class="ghub_link">Github link coming soon</em>-->
					<p>In 2012, while I was living in NZ, a graphic artist friend of mine designed a website for his client. I asked if I could create the website as practise, so he sent me the Photoshop files. I used the files to create a demo website using my existing knowledge of HTML and teaching myself CSS along the way.</p>

					<h3>PowerShell Scripts</h3>
					<h4>Active Directory & Exchange</h4> 
					<img src="images\CreatePublicFolder_PowerShell_screenshot.jpg" alt="Screenshot of PowerShell Script">
					<p>Back in 2016-17, while doing Windows support in a corporate ennvironment using Active Directory (AD) & Exchange mail server, I discovered that Powershell could be used to create scripts for reptitive tasks. So I taught myself enough Powershell to write scripts for creating public folders and shared mailboxes. About a year later I rewrote (refactored) the shared mailbox script, as I had improved my knowledge & understanding of Powershell</p>
					<p>Then the company we were supporting had a bit of a restructure and my manager had to move a lot of user objects into differnt departments units under different managers. This also meant that he had to transfer ownership of security groups from one manager to another. He was doing all this extra admin work in his evenings, so I created a few scripts to help him do this more quickly & easily. </p>
					<p>Some of the longer scripts I created were:
						<em class="ghub_link">GitHub links below:</em></p>

						<li><a href="https://github.com/davin2020/powershell/blob/master/Export_ADGroups_ManagedBy_Redacted.ps1">Export AD Groups Managed by User X</a></li>
